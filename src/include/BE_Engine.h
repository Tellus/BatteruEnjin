		 *	- Turns
		 *	- Decision-making for Character-bound Behaviour objects.
		 *	- Globally (static) available references to keyword references from script.
		 *		- User (updated before AI tree calculation to point to current Char).
		 *		- Target (container of targets for an ability).
		 *		- etc (see language reference for a comprehensive list of these refs)
		 * Do note, however, that the engine delegates actions to the objects in play.
		 * While it will calculate rule-specific results to avoid cheating, it will
		 * prefer to let other objects handle the preliminary work (an effect
		 * determining damage, for example, or an ability creating and invoking those
		 * effects).

			 * - EEM_SINGLE_STEP. The engine executes an entire turn and then yields to
